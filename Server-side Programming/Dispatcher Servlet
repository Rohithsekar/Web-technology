A DispatcherServlet is a key component in the Spring Framework's web MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture. It acts as a central hub or front controller for processing incoming web 
requests and dispatching them to the appropriate handlers (controllers) for further processing.

When a web request is received, the DispatcherServlet intercepts it and analyzes the request URL to determine the appropriate handler mapping and controller for processing the request. It
consults the configured handler mappings to find the appropriate controller that can handle the request.

The DispatcherServlet also manages other components involved in request processing, such as view resolvers for rendering the response, and interceptors for handling cross-cutting concerns
like logging, security, or authentication. It coordinates the execution flow and delegates the request to the chosen controller, which performs the necessary business logic and prepares 
the response.

Once the controller has processed the request, it returns a model object or a view name to the DispatcherServlet. The DispatcherServlet then consults the configured view resolvers to find
the appropriate view template for rendering the response. It passes the model object to the selected view, which generates the final response HTML, JSON, XML, or any other format.

The DispatcherServlet plays a crucial role in decoupling the web framework from the application-specific controllers and views. It provides a flexible and extensible architecture for
handling web requests and processing responses in a consistent and modular manner.
